## Running Locally

Run with a Local Development Server 

Using a local server avoids potential issues with module loading and file paths.

#### Using VS Code Live Server

1. Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Right-click `index.html`.
4. Click **"Open with Live Server"**.

#### Using Node (http-server)

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
npx serve .
```

or

```bash
npx http-server .
```

Then open the local URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000` or similar).
